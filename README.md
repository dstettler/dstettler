I'm Devon, a hobbyist game dev/programmer/computer man studying Computer Engineering at the University of Florida.
I don't usually push much of my stuff out publicly, but I have some interesting stuff in the works so I'll try to keep this
up to date as best I can.

Pronouns: He/Him 

I mostly work in C#, JavaScript, and Python, but I have experience with GTK+ and Qt C++ as well.

Some frameworks I have experience with:
- Vue.js
- ReactJS
- Quasar Framework
- Qt
- GTK

I've also done game dev work in Unreal Engine 4 and Unity as well, though those projects are less relevant here.
